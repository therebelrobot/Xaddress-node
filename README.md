# Xaddress-node
A Node port of Xaddress - Work in progress

For current progress on Xaddress proper, please refer to [the original repo](https://github.com/roberdam/Xaddress).

The goals of this repo aim to have 1:1 parity with the Ruby library currently in development. 

#### Contribution

Feel free to take a swing at the source, I'll be building the basics out over the next few days. PRs/Issues welcome.
